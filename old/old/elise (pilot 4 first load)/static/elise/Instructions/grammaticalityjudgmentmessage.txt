Keep it up! 

Remember:

Indicate whether you think the phrase you hear is grammatical in the new language, or not. 

If you don't know for sure, just make your best guess.


Finally, don't worry too much about how many you get right - we learn a lot from any response you give, so just make your best guess. You will probably do a lot better than you realize!
