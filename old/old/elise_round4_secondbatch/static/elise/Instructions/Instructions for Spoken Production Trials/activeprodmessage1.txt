Next, you'll do an active learning round. Active learning will help you remember the words better.

In active learning, you will see a picture and an icon of a microphone on the screen. Whenever you see a microphone, you should try to describe the picture in the novel language. 

After you speak, press ENTER. You will then hear the correct description of the picture. The picture will have a green square around it. The green square is your signal, in the whole experiment, that you are hearing a description of what you are seeing. You don't have to press any keys when you see the green square.

Don't worry if you don't know the words very well yet - we don't expect you to. It is important that you make a guess out loud even if you are unsure. Speaking will help you learn the words. 

Whenever you see an instruction screen that says "ACTIVE LEARNING BLOCK," you'll get to practice words like this where you have to say out loud what the name of the picture is in the novel language.
