Welcome to our Experiment! 

Since this is an online experiment, we will be monitoring your progress. Treat this as you would an in person experiment. That means that you need to be alone, in a quiet room. Make sure there is no TV or music playing in the background. 


This experiment is relatively long (about 1 hour), so there will be designated break times indicated by the words 'TAKE A BREAK IF YOU NEED TO'. If you step away from the computer for more than 1 minute while there is no break, or for more than 5 minutes during a break, the experiment will halt and you won't get credit for the full experiment. 


Let's get started!
