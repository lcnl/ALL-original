Welcome to our Experiment! 

In this experiment, you'll be learning a new language. Some of the time, you'll simply be hearing words in the language and looking at pictures of what the word refers to. We'll call this 'passive learning'. At other times, you'll be doing 'active learning', in which you try to say the words in the language.  

Before we start, we'll explain the general structure of the experiment.
