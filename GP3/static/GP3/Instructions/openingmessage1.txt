Welcome to our Experiment! 

This experiment is relatively long (about 1 hour and 15 minutes), so there will be designated break times indicated by the words 'TAKE A BREAK IF YOU NEED TO'. If you step away from the computer for more than 1 minute while there is no break, or for more than 5 minutes during a break, the experiment will halt and you won't get credit for the full experiment. 


Let's get started!
