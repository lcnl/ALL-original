Before we start with the experiment, we want to make sure the sound setting is working well for you. We will have several of these sound checks during the experiment.

In a sound check, you will hear a simple English word. Your job is simply to type in the word, no capitalization needed.

For this first sound check, you will have the opportunity to replay the sound. So, if you don't hear anything initially, make sure your computer sound is on and you allow sound in the browser. If you have trouble hearing the sound, please get the experimenter, and they can help you adjust the volume. Then, press 'repeat audio'.
