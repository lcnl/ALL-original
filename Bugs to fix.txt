EH1: pics disappear before audio is done, check timings
EH2: some pics are too big (1600x1600)
EH3: subtitle prompts don't match what's said; specifically, the determiner and suffix are correct but the stem is wrong
Solution: Line 307 in utilities shuffles prompts and sounds separately, remove prompts from dict and lookup when calling experiment functions on the spot
EH4: right now, my Firefox browser, on production trials, suggests what to type based on what I typed on previous trials. Is there a way to block this? It's pretty bad for the scientific integrity if people can see their previous guesses; they should really be trying from a blank slate each trial.
FIXED  
EH5: my terminal has a funny message (I think only after I closed the experiment?) that doesn't seem to cause problems:
127.0.0.1 - - [21/Dec/2020 14:18:31] code 404, message File not found
127.0.0.1 - - [21/Dec/2020 14:18:31] "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 404 -

Next steps:
LR1: messages [explained] (straightforward)
LR2: implement audio check trials [explained] (straightforward)
LR3: forced choice 2 pics (medium)
LR4: forced choice 4 pics (medium+)
LR5: grammaticality judgment (medium++)
LR6: production test (straightforward)
LR7: logging (straightforward but a lot)


Done:
