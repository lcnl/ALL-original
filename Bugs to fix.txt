BUGS: EH85



Meeting w MM: 

- with pictures in EM now so def important to stop audio if ppl press quickly
- ok to run some ppl in person; allows more debriefing but is different population. 1 at a time is ok for piloting but not for real. 
- ask participants explicitly to do experiment alone in room without music/media/friends etc. Add to SONA/Qualtrics!!


Next steps: 

EH81: upload new version to server (with longer pause before EM audio) & test with bad wifi

EH80: write script to analyze break time / time experiment takes
EH77: polish audio stimuli
MM/EH: decide on SC cutoff: >1 (2+) real errors, >2?3? (3+?4+?) Typos cutoff
EH66: preregister study as predicted


Levi:
EH78: stop audio on button press in EM & FC
EH83: ask Arella for sound sample code & implement quick sound recordings
DONE (not tested on server)
EH84: troubleshoot this....
EH17: in active comp trial, I want feedback to show below picture, and without the picture moving to the side
EH29: re-introduce the green square around passive + feedback phase of active trials? If so, put back in relevant instructions too. 
MM3: change font in Gramm judgment & active comp.
EH76: time out audio on button press in active comp, 2AFC, 4AFC, grammar judgment.
MM: do brief audio recordings to check for background noise at different points
ML/EH: need video (10 frames) trials for motivation experiment

Left to do before SONA: 

ML5: With regards to the sound recordings:
Some of the recordings had some crackling sounds (I only noticed it at the beginning)
Some of the recordings ended on different pitches 

EH25: double check all audio to see if pronunciation of stems match; note down stems where I find pronunciation weird or where audio volume is awkward. NOTED: monok; zimbaaf;stam; dap; chag; jeb (cheb); burresh; bepaaf; frusok; heefaaf; heefesh; 


Maybe/Later/dependent on feedback:

MC: make passive trials either self-guided or slower to give people more time to read the spellings/names?
EH54: let experiment time out in all trial types except passive after 30 seconds (?) of inactivity
IV: too many breaks, tempted to stop, made it hard to concentrate. 
DM3: Practice rounds may be helpful to avoid any skewed data due to people not understanding



Done: 
EH1: pics disappear before audio is done, check timings
FIXED
EH2: some pics are too big (1600x1600)
FIXED
EH3: subtitle prompts don't match what's said; specifically, the determiner and suffix are correct but the stem is wrong
FIXED
EH4: right now, my Firefox browser, on production trials, suggests what to type based on what I typed on previous trials. Is there a way to block this? It's pretty bad for the scientific integrity if people can see their previous guesses; they should really be trying from a blank slate each trial.
FIXED  
EH8: Audiochecktrials can end way earlier than they currently do. They can end right after the participant types in what they heard, no need to show the pic and repeat the audio afterwards. 
FIXED
EH10: the 4 alternative forced choice trial needs to end right when the participant makes their choice. So no feedback (cross/check) and no correct image + sound again. 
FIXED
EH11: instead of having the text with all key-options at the bottom in the 4AFC trial, ideally I'd have it right by the pictures. I'm going to send you a ppt image of what I am hoping it may look like - I also want the images farther apart (though admittedly I don't know how that would interact with screen size). 
FIXED
EH12: for the grammaticality judgment trials, end them right when the participant presses a button, no feedback (e.g. green cross).
FIXED
EH14: for the 2 alternative forced choice trial, the trial should end right after the participant puts in their response; so no feedback, no showing the correct image, no repeating the sound. 
FIXED
EH15: for the 2 and 4 AFC trials, as well as the grammaticality judgment trials, I want the button presses to correspond geographically to the answer options. So right no on 2afc it was l for the left pic and a for the right pic, but I want it flipped, cause a is on the left on standard keyboards and l is on the right; same for grammaticality judgment trial (a & ungrammatical should be on the left of screen; l & grammatical on right of screen). For 4AFC it should be a (left top), z (left bottom), l (right top), m (right bottom) - I haven't triple checked how that's currently set up.
FIXED 
EH9: I assume you're planning to make it so that an input to the audiochecktrial is which audio it plays? Instead of hardcoding 'pizza' - just remove this comment if you were gonna do that while putting the audiochecktrials in the timeline.
FIXED
EH6: right now the aliens that are plural (anything ending in -ool and -af) are showing as singular pictures; there should be two pictures showing side by side for plural trials. Note that you do already have this as input into the trial (whether it's plural or singular) so it shouldn't be much work. For plural it should just show two pictures of the same alien right next to each other as close as possible.
FIXED
EH18: the 2AFC images show up too big and too close together; check 4AFC code for solution?; Nope, also wrong in 4AFC images.
FIXED
EH13: I want the text on which buttons to press to show up a bit differently: further apart, with 'ungrammatical push a' all the way at the left of the screen and 'grammatical push l' on the right of the screen.
FIXED
EH20: there are errors in prompts.js
FIXED
EH16: foils for active comp trials are currently ANY alien except itself; need to at least make this any alien from same cell; possibly make this also include plural foils. 
FIXED
EH21: currently it is playing all (passive) trials as plurals
FIXED 
EH23: zimbaaf is not as loud as all other words
FIXED
EH24: One random mismatch trial per active comprehension block should be a plural error.
FIXED
EH30: adjust audiochecktrials; replace 'what is the item' with 'type the English word you hear', replace 'continue' with 'next', change break screen to 'TAKE A BREAK IF YOU NEED TO, but no longer than 5 minutes. (With 'continue' instead of 'next')'
FIXED
EH31: include screens before sound check saying SOUND CHECK
FIXED
EH32: create screens for after sound check trials in the grammar judgment and 4AFC tests to remind people of what the test is about. 
FIXED
EH33: experiment only reads in the first 11 blocks
FIXED
EH34: experiment doesn't play soundchecktrials during training, modulo statement doesn't work
FIXED
EH36: read in subject number from url
FIXED
EH22: take underscore out of prompts
FIXED
EH19: recenter the singular pics as being in the middle of an 800x400 slide to line them up nicer for 4AFC
FIXED
NS1: put messages in actual timeline for both conditions
DONE
NS2: implement audio check trials [explained] (straightforward)
DONE
EH35: currently not logging data for audiochecktrials and passive trials
FIXED
EH37: send data back to server
FIXED
EH39: prompts all show up as 'undefined' on server.... [both conditions, it works on the first block of passive trials, stops after that. Same problem when tested on localhost] 
FIXED
EH40: comprehension condition prompts show up out of whack & prod instead of comp
FIXED
EH26: Need whitespace to show up in the instructions
FIXED
EH38: write script to get data in readable format
FIXED
EH42: it always logs 'l' for the key that's the correct answer in 2AFC (so right before RT)
FIXED
NS3: forced choice 2 pics (medium)
DONE 
EH43: getting a really weird jspsych error; moved almost full utilities into backup, the problem seems to be with initializing the files; NO CLUE but it resolved itself?
FIXED
NS4: forced choice 4 pics (medium+)
DONE 
NS5: grammaticality judgment (medium++)
DONE
LR6: production test (straightforward)
DONE
LR7: logging (straightforward but a lot)
DONE 
MM2: make all on-screen letters capitals so that L is clearer ALSO IN INSTR
DONE
EH46: put in all instructions screens in test phase
DONE
EH52: pick audios that are less ambiguous
DONE
EH51: normalize sound volume audiochecktrials
DONE
EH52: take ambiguous flower/flour out of audiochecktrials
DONE
EH44: test full experiment on server
DONE
EH45: get logs uniform
DONE
EH53 work through pilot subject comments and create to do list
DONE
SP5: The blue bird figure from the second half of the experiment is a drawing very based on a kids Cartoon Network series called the regular show - I had to look it up but kids I nanny used to watch it so people may already have a memory associated with it (note: h5.png, and it does indeed look a lot like the cartoon character, probably replace if at all possible)
DONE
ML/MC/SP: note in insert that spelling does not matter for the test at the end
DONE
ML3: For the sound checks, does capitalization matter? (may want to mention this in the sound check instructions)
DONE
SP4: Progression bar at the bottom maybe? I dont know if that is too distracting I just know during online studies it motivates me to actually work hard until the end and I know there are notes throughout saying when you get close 
DONE
ML4: Since you’re explaining the general idea behind the passive and active learning trials before they happen, idk that you need such a long summary at the beginning of the experiment.
DONE
ML7: Was there a full screen option I missed? (It might help to offer a full screen option to reduce distractions)
DONE
ML2: Instructions seem really spread out across the screen. Can they be centered more? (i.e. add additional padding within the div…?)
DONE
SP1: Click to start in the corner feels weird compared to the text being in the center for the rest of the time - I didn’t notice it right away 
DONE 
SP2: Some sentences in the instructions during it are normal grammar and some do not have capitalization “you’ll get to practice words like this where you… Let’s continue learning”
DONE
ML11: For some of the tests, the instructions said we’d see that we’re ¼ done, etc. but I didn’t actually see those messages.
DONE (untested)
SP3: Maybe add a countdown timer for the breaks? If It is easy could be a nice additive otherwise not something super needed 
DONE 
EH55 analyze or at least look at pilot pp scores on tests
DONE
ML8: Would it be possible to auto-focus on the text-boxes so you don’t have to click into the text box for every active trial/test?
DONE
ML/SP: After the summary screen, I just saw a blank screen...was I supposed to see a survey?
DONE
EH57: experiment times out, need to fix timer in soundchecktrials
DONE
EH7: right now I need to click on the textbox separately for each separate production trial. Is there an easy way to have the cursor start there automatically for each trial? This is way less important than the other stuff, more a convenience thing.
LR:Can't move user's cursor in chrome
DONE
EH41:active prod trial needs to log correct prompt for easy grading
DONE
EH58:send a timestamp when participant is done
DONE
EH56: text for timer after soundchecktrials needs to be less wide
DONE
ML1: Consider changing tab text from ‘My Experiment’ to something like LCNL Experiment or something
DONE
ML9: Double check that all of the next buttons can be triggered by clicking the enter button! (Rn instructions no next trial yes)
DONE for instructions, just doesn't work on the very first trial (fullscreen mode)
EH49: enforce the max 5 min breaks
DONE
EH50: time/progress indication on breaks in tests? 
DONE
EH47: make sure audio ends on keypress in EM/FC/AC
DONE
EH28: make 'next' / 'continue' consistent. Maybe continue if instructions, next if trial?
DONE
EH48: remove the break after the final audiochecktrial?
DONE
EH27: read through all instructions and make sure they are all consistent, grammatical, etc; replace 'trial' with 'exercise', 'block' with 'round/exercises'.
EH59: flesh out text on scoring system w examples (in table) in .Rmd
DONE
EH60: look at neigh x sub neigh x condition not just for total scores but for different elements of the language
DONE
EH61: reanalyze EM using signal detection
DONE
EH63: go through pilot feedback in feedback survey
DONE
EH71: not all soundcheck trials seem to log / get analyzed.... [I think in R!! Yep, to do with different versions logging slightly different]
DONE
EH62: consider adding pictures (or captions) during EM test to help make it easier [I think yes but want to discuss w MM; once this is decided I can run some RA pilots]
DONE
EH70: figure out how much longer an extra 28 EM trials would make the experiment as a whole [3 minutes, so I vote yes]
DONE
EH67: look at timestamps to see how long the study took pilot apps [about 1 hour actual experiment time, a bit longer with breaks and surveys]
DONE
EH73: weird bug in R where it reads in true/false as strings for all but s71914; even same version s71804
DONE
EH74: NEED to log sound-durations... for processing RT's!!
DONE in R
EH64: process RT's
DONE
EH65: look at RT's for pilots
DONE
EH69: MAJOR BUG: only doing 3 (instead of 4) rounds of error monitoring.... [adding this would take 3 extra minutes]
DONE
EH72: add pictures to EM
DONE
EH68: make sure logging is flawless, still uneven columns right now
DONE
EH75: bug test:
- check that logs are flawless
- check browser log w inactivity etc. 
DONE
ML/EH/IV: images didn't load smoothly
DONE
EH78: introduce 'do not close browser until' and 'you are now fine to close browser' language in instructions
DONE
DM1: the letter choices "a" for left and "l" for right are very confusing- people automatically associate "l" with left
DONE
IV1: Lastly, I think it would've been helpful to have a small description in the beginning stating that the experiment would test our knowledge in different ways.
DONE
DM2:  no initial instructions about how the study is going to work. It took me a few rounds to understand it.  The study would be a lot more interesting and engaging if people knew what was going on. an explanation of why the study is happening may create more of an incentive
EH79: get browserinteractions to log in array. Following columns: browser, event, trial, time, event2, trial2, time2, timediff; browser only probed once just logged same for every row. Event2 etc only necessary if it was a blur/focus sequence. 
DONE
EH82: save to server earlier [after training and after each test maybe?]
DONE
EH79: work thru 3 new pilot data (first python step done, now R, python, R to do)
DONE

Abandoned:

EH5: my terminal has a funny message (I think only after I closed the experiment?) that doesn't seem to cause problems:
127.0.0.1 - - [21/Dec/2020 14:18:31] code 404, message File not found
127.0.0.1 - - [21/Dec/2020 14:18:31] "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 404 -
I'd have to upload a favicon.ico to appear in the tab of the browser; not worthwhile/necessary.
ElPi: add instructions on dragging window bigger if size not ok; move that check to after fullscreen.
This is done in jspysch.js, I don't really want to mess with that ....
