EH1: pics disappear before audio is done, check timings
FIXED
EH2: some pics are too big (1600x1600)
FIXED
EH3: subtitle prompts don't match what's said; specifically, the determiner and suffix are correct but the stem is wrong
FIXED
EH4: right now, my Firefox browser, on production trials, suggests what to type based on what I typed on previous trials. Is there a way to block this? It's pretty bad for the scientific integrity if people can see their previous guesses; they should really be trying from a blank slate each trial.
FIXED  
EH5: my terminal has a funny message (I think only after I closed the experiment?) that doesn't seem to cause problems:
127.0.0.1 - - [21/Dec/2020 14:18:31] code 404, message File not found
127.0.0.1 - - [21/Dec/2020 14:18:31] "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 404 -
EH6: right now the aliens that are plural (anything ending in -ool and -af) are showing as singular pictures; there should be two pictures showing side by side for plural trials. Note that you do already have this as input into the trial (whether it's plural or singular) so it shouldn't be much work. For plural it should just show two pictures of the same alien right next to each other as close as possible.
EH7: right now I need to click on the textbox separately for each separate production trial. Is there an easy way to have the cursor start there automatically for each trial? This is way less important than the other stuff, more a convenience thing.


Next steps:
LR1: messages [explained] (straightforward)
LR2: implement audio check trials [explained] (straightforward)
DONE - place corrections in bugs, not yet implemented into full trial sequence
LR3: forced choice 2 pics (medium)
DONE - place corrections in bugs, not yet implemented into full trial sequence
LR4: forced choice 4 pics (medium+)
DONE - place corrections in bugs, not yet implemented into full trial sequence
LR5: grammaticality judgment (medium++)
DONE - place corrections in bugs, not yet implemented into full trial sequence
LR6: production test (straightforward)
LR7: logging (straightforward but a lot)


Done:
