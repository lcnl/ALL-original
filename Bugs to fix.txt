EH1: pics disappear before audio is done, check timings
EH2: some pics are too big (1600x1600)
EH3: subtitle prompts don't match what's said; specifically, the determiner and suffix are correct but the stem is wrong
EH5: right now, my Firefox browser, on production trials, suggests what to type based on what I typed on previous trials. Is there a way to block this? It's pretty bad for the scientific integrity if people can see their previous guesses; they should really be trying from a blank slate each trial. 
EH6: my terminal has a funny message (I think only after I closed the experiment?) that doesn't seem to cause problems:
127.0.0.1 - - [21/Dec/2020 14:18:31] code 404, message File not found
127.0.0.1 - - [21/Dec/2020 14:18:31] "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 404 -
