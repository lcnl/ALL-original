BUGS:


EH43:

Next steps:
NS3: forced choice 2 pics (medium)
DONE - not yet implemented into full trial sequence
NS4: forced choice 4 pics (medium+)
DONE - not yet implemented into full trial sequence
NS5: grammaticality judgment (medium++)
DONE - not yet implemented into full trial sequence
LR6: production test (straightforward)
LR7: logging (straightforward but a lot)
DONE - for passive, active c+p, soundchecktrials; rest will be similar

Maybe/Later:
EH17: in active comp trial, I want feedback to show below picture, and without the picture moving to the side
EH25: double check all audio to see if pronunciation of stems match; note down stems where I find pronunciation weird or where audio volume is awkward. NOTED: monok; zimbaaf; NOTED: stam; dap; chag; 
EH27: read through all instructions and make sure they are all consistent, grammatical, etc; replace 'trial' with 'exercise', 'block' with 'group'.
EH28: make 'next' / 'continue' consistent. Maybe continue if instructions, next if trial?
EH29: re-introduce the green square around passive + feedback phase of active trials? If so, put back in relevant instructions too. 
EH41:active prod trial needs to log correct prompt for easy grading



Done: 
EH1: pics disappear before audio is done, check timings
FIXED
EH2: some pics are too big (1600x1600)
FIXED
EH3: subtitle prompts don't match what's said; specifically, the determiner and suffix are correct but the stem is wrong
FIXED
EH4: right now, my Firefox browser, on production trials, suggests what to type based on what I typed on previous trials. Is there a way to block this? It's pretty bad for the scientific integrity if people can see their previous guesses; they should really be trying from a blank slate each trial.
FIXED  
EH8: Audiochecktrials can end way earlier than they currently do. They can end right after the participant types in what they heard, no need to show the pic and repeat the audio afterwards. 
FIXED
EH10: the 4 alternative forced choice trial needs to end right when the participant makes their choice. So no feedback (cross/check) and no correct image + sound again. 
FIXED
EH11: instead of having the text with all key-options at the bottom in the 4AFC trial, ideally I'd have it right by the pictures. I'm going to send you a ppt image of what I am hoping it may look like - I also want the images farther apart (though admittedly I don't know how that would interact with screen size). 
FIXED
EH12: for the grammaticality judgment trials, end them right when the participant presses a button, no feedback (e.g. green cross).
FIXED
EH14: for the 2 alternative forced choice trial, the trial should end right after the participant puts in their response; so no feedback, no showing the correct image, no repeating the sound. 
FIXED
EH15: for the 2 and 4 AFC trials, as well as the grammaticality judgment trials, I want the button presses to correspond geographically to the answer options. So right no on 2afc it was l for the left pic and a for the right pic, but I want it flipped, cause a is on the left on standard keyboards and l is on the right; same for grammaticality judgment trial (a & ungrammatical should be on the left of screen; l & grammatical on right of screen). For 4AFC it should be a (left top), z (left bottom), l (right top), m (right bottom) - I haven't triple checked how that's currently set up.
FIXED 
EH9: I assume you're planning to make it so that an input to the audiochecktrial is which audio it plays? Instead of hardcoding 'pizza' - just remove this comment if you were gonna do that while putting the audiochecktrials in the timeline.
FIXED
EH6: right now the aliens that are plural (anything ending in -ool and -af) are showing as singular pictures; there should be two pictures showing side by side for plural trials. Note that you do already have this as input into the trial (whether it's plural or singular) so it shouldn't be much work. For plural it should just show two pictures of the same alien right next to each other as close as possible.
FIXED
EH18: the 2AFC images show up too big and too close together; check 4AFC code for solution?; Nope, also wrong in 4AFC images.
FIXED
EH13: I want the text on which buttons to press to show up a bit differently: further apart, with 'ungrammatical push a' all the way at the left of the screen and 'grammatical push l' on the right of the screen.
FIXED
EH20: there are errors in prompts.js
FIXED
EH16: foils for active comp trials are currently ANY alien except itself; need to at least make this any alien from same cell; possibly make this also include plural foils. 
FIXED
EH21: currently it is playing all (passive) trials as plurals
FIXED 
EH23: zimbaaf is not as loud as all other words
FIXED
EH24: One random mismatch trial per active comprehension block should be a plural error.
FIXED
EH30: adjust audiochecktrials; replace 'what is the item' with 'type the English word you hear', replace 'continue' with 'next', change break screen to 'TAKE A BREAK IF YOU NEED TO, but no longer than 5 minutes. (With 'continue' instead of 'next')'
FIXED
EH31: include screens before sound check saying SOUND CHECK
FIXED
EH32: create screens for after sound check trials in the grammar judgment and 4AFC tests to remind people of what the test is about. 
FIXED
EH33: experiment only reads in the first 11 blocks
FIXED
EH34: experiment doesn't play soundchecktrials during training, modulo statement doesn't work
FIXED
EH36: read in subject number from url
FIXED
EH22: take underscore out of prompts
FIXED
EH19: recenter the singular pics as being in the middle of an 800x400 slide to line them up nicer for 4AFC
FIXED
NS1: put messages in actual timeline for both conditions
DONE
NS2: implement audio check trials [explained] (straightforward)
DONE
EH35: currently not logging data for audiochecktrials and passive trials
FIXED
EH37: send data back to server
FIXED
EH39: prompts all show up as 'undefined' on server.... [both conditions, it works on the first block of passive trials, stops after that. Same problem when tested on localhost] 
FIXED
EH40: comprehension condition prompts show up out of whack & prod instead of comp
FIXED
EH26: Need whitespace to show up in the instructions
FIXED
EH38: write script to get data in readable format
FIXED
EH42: it always logs 'l' for the key that's the correct answer in 2AFC (so right before RT)
FIXED

Abandoned:
EH7: right now I need to click on the textbox separately for each separate production trial. Is there an easy way to have the cursor start there automatically for each trial? This is way less important than the other stuff, more a convenience thing.
LR:Can't move user's cursor in chrome
EH5: my terminal has a funny message (I think only after I closed the experiment?) that doesn't seem to cause problems:
127.0.0.1 - - [21/Dec/2020 14:18:31] code 404, message File not found
