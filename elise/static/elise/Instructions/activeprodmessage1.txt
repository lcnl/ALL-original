Next, you'll do an active learning round. Active learning will help you remember the words better.

In active learning, you will see a picture and an icon of a keyboard on the screen. Whenever you see a keyboard, you should try to describe the picture in the novel language by typing the words. 

After you type the words that match the picture you see, click 'next'. You will then hear the correct description of the picture. 

Don't worry if you don't know the words very well yet - we don't expect you to. It is important that you make a guess even if you are unsure. Typing the words will help you learn them. 

Whenever you see an instruction screen that says "ACTIVE LEARNING BLOCK," you'll get to practice words like this where you have to type what the name of the picture is in the novel language.
