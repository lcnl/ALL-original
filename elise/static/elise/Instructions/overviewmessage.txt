You'll start with hearing one group of words passively, then you'll have an active learning round which will help you learn those words. After that, you'll move on to another group of words, again first with passive and then by active learning. You'll learn words in the language this way.

At the end of the experiment, you'll get tested on the new language.

This experiment is relatively long (about 1 hour), but we will let you know how far along you are at different points during the second half of the experiment. You will have the opportunity for short breaks as needed, indicated by the words TAKE A BREAK IF YOU NEED TO. Remember not to take breaks at other times!
