Wonderful job! 

Now we are going to challenge you and test you with four sets of aliens, instead of two. Just like earlier, you'll see aliens and hear a description in the novel language. Again, you will chose which set of aliens the description matches. Your job is to pick out the correct one with a button press. This time though, there will be aliens in all 4 corners of the screen! 

Press 'x' for the left bottom picture and 'm' for the picture on the right bottom. Press 'w' for the top left picture and 'i' for the top right picture. 

In order to answer quickly once the sound is over, keep your left middle finger on the 'w' key, your left index finger on the 'x' key. Meanwhile, keep your right middle finger on the 'i' key and your right index finger on the 'm' key so that you're ready to answer quickly.

This test will be longer than the previous one, but not very long, so this test itself will have no breaks.
