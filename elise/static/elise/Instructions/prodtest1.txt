Excellent! 

In the next and final round we are going to challenge you even more. You will be tested to see how well you can name the pictures you see in the novel language. 

When you see a picture please type the words in the novel language that match the picture. You will see a picture of a keyboard to let you know it's time to type. Don't worry if you aren't sure if you are correct; it is important for you to type your best guess. 

If you only know part of the description, type 'something' where you know there should be (part of) a word. For example, if you were describing a picture of a colored house but you forgot the English word for the color, you might type 'the something house' to indicate that you know there should be a color word and where that word should be in the phrase. 

As another example, let's say you are trying to simply type 'the house' in Spanish, but you forgot what determiners Spanish has. In that case you might type 'something casa' to indicate that you know a word should go before casa. However, if you do know that Spanish has 'la' and 'el' as determiners but you forgot which one goes with house, just type your best guess: 'el casa', even though it's wrong, still sounds better than 'something casa'. 


This test will have break screens that tell you your progress (at 1/4th, 2/4th and 3/4th). After this test, the only thing left to do will be a really brief survey.
