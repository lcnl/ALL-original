Great work! 

In this next round you will hear a few words in the new language. Some of the phrases may be grammatically correct and others may not be. 

If you hear a phrase and think it is grammatically correct please press "m", if you hear a phrase and think it is not grammatically correct press "x". 

To make it a bit more difficult, unlike in the last trials, you will see no images on screen.

In order to be able to answer quickly once the sound is over, please keep your fingers on the keys. 

This task will be a bit longer than the previous two short tests, so this time around you will get breaks during the test (at 1/6th, 2/6th, etc.). After this one there is only one more task! Keep up the great work!
