Great work! 

In this next round you will hear a few words in the new language. Some of the phrases may be grammatically correct and others may not be. 

If you hear a phrase and think it is grammatically correct please press "L", if you hear a phrase and think it is not grammatically correct press "A". 

To make it a bit more difficult, unlike in the last tests, you will see no images on screen.

In order to be able to answer quickly once the sound is over, please keep your fingers on the keys. 

This test will have break screens that tell you your progress (at 1/4th, 2/4th and 3/4th). After this one there is only one more test! Keep up the great work!
