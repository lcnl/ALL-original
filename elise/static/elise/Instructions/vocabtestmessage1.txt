Let's see if you know the words in the language! 

In this round called you'll see two pictures on the screen and you'll hear a description. Indicate which picture matches the description that you hear. Press 'x' for the left picture and 'm' for the picture on the right. 

Unlike earlier, you won't receive any sort of feedback after you answer.

In order to be able to answer fast, keep your left index finger on the 'x' key and your right index finger on the 'm' key so that you're ready to answer when you hear the word.
