Keep it up! 

Remember:

Indicate which alien you think is being described in the novel language.

If you don't know for sure, just make your best guess.

Finally, don't worry too much about how many you get right - we learn a lot from any response you give, so just make your best guess. You will probably do a lot better than you realize!
