Great job so far! 

This next round will have a very similar set up to the last round, but instead of two pictures on screen you will see four pictures and you'll hear one name. 

Indicate which picture matches the name that you hear. Press 'x' for the bottom left picture and 'm' for the picture on the bottom right. Press 'w' for the top left picture and 'i' for the the top right picture.

Again in this round, you will not receive any sort of feedback after you answer.

In order to be able to answer fast, please keep your fingers on the keys so that you're ready to answer when you hear the word.
