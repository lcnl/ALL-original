Now, we'll start with learning the first group of phrases. This first round is passive learning. In what follows, you'll see a picture and hear the description for it in a new language. To help you learn each word, you will see the picture and hear the description twice in a row. The second time, the phrase will also be written out. You do not need to push any buttons in this part of the experiment. Just try to learn the words.

Whenever you see an instruction screen saying "PASSIVE LEARNING EXERCISES," you will get a chance to learn more words in the new language in this way.
