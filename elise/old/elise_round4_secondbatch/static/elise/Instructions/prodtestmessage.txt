Keep it up! Most people do much better during this test than they think they can.

Remember:

Type the words that match each picture!

If you don't know the exact words, just make your best guess in the language.

If you really don't know a word, type 'something' in the place of that word.

Finally, don't worry too much about how many you get right or about precise spelling - we learn a lot from anything you type, so just make your best guess. You will probably do a lot better than you realize!
