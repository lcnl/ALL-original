In this experiment, you'll be learning a new language using different types of practice exercises. At the end of the experiment, you'll get tested on the new language in different ways.

Second language learning is really important! Besides allowing you to interact with more people and cultures in other languages, fluency in a second language can help your job prospects and some research even suggests it has cognitive benefits like improved decision making and staving of cognitive decline at a later age. However, many adults have a hard time learning a second language, so the goal of this experiment is to figure out how to make second language learning more effective. 

By participating in this experiment, you will help us improve second language learning, so that more people can have the benefits of fluency in a second language!
